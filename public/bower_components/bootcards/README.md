Bootcards: Bootstrap and a Cards UI
=========

Bootcards is a cards-based UI framework. It is built on top of Bootstrap and uses it's responsive features. Bootcards has a native look on Android, iOS and desktop.

**Why Bootcards?**

We think Cards are the design pattern for mobile of the future. The near future that is. Cards are appearing already on sites and apps like Twitter, Google Now, Facebook, Spotify, Pinterest, and Amazon. To kickstart your (and our) projects we decided to create Bootcards.

**Work in progress**

Bootcards is work in progress. You'll find a first beta release in this repository. We're working on a demo app showcasing what the framework (and your apps) can look like. Please let us know what you think!
