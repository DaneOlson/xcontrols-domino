# XControls

A new set of Controls for IBM Domino XPage developers working on new XPages apps and on app modernisation projects.

XControls is built on top of [Bootstrap 3.x](http://getbootstrap.com) and the [Bootcards project](http://bootcards.org). It enables XPage developers to create controls that are responsive, optimizing to the device whether it be a smartphone, a tablet or a PC.

XControls was designed with three key goals in mind:
* Enable faster design and assembly of modern user interfaces, using Card & List objects (analagous to Forms and Views in traditional Notes development)
* Make it easy to write an XPages app which auto-optimizes to smartphones, tablets and PCs.
* Make it easy to create XPages apps which work offline on mobile devices (via the Teamstudio Unplugged XPages engine for iOS and Android)
